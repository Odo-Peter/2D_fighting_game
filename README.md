# 2D_FIGHTING_GAME 🎮🕹

## An easy to play game, inspired by CHRIS COURSE from youtube, great guy ❤.

### Have you ever thought of learning programming concepts and having fun at the same time, yeah?.... Then building fun games in the language you love is a go to approach to consider. Buiding this fun javaScript project, many new concepts were learned, concepts like dynamic programming, Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the power of the "this" keyword.

### The game comprises of two characters, SAMURAI JACK at the left half of the screen and KENSHI at the right, the illusion of animation was achieved by looping through a single image with several frames, croppng them appropraitely to a desired width and height. So many concepts were learned 😪😪, so in due time, I'ma come update this readme with some knowledge, but for now, enjoy the game.....
